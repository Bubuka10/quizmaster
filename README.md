# 🎯 QuizMaster

**QuizMaster** is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), developed as part of my BSc thesis in Software Engineering at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE).  
It allows users to take quizzes, view results, and compete on a leaderboard — with an admin interface for managing quizzes.
